? PileFannedRect no correct after building up tableau
?  only correct when card transitioning
x Refan not working as expected after changing cards from fixed to scaled
x Tap on stock not working as expected
x  card movement & new position not being shown
x move IsStock out of base
 move anything out of base that requires pile
 don't record Pile interface in Base
   why not? what's the workaround?

 decide how to represent Vector2 and Rectangle
    image.Point X,Y int
    image.Rectangle Min,Max point
    (gomps4 uses x,y,width,height Rectangle)
    image.Rectangle.Dx / Dy to get width, height

 don't fire up the UI
 take out load/save state
 take out undo
 scrunch can be a no-op for now

 cards with pips are easier to scan ...
 retire saving individual saved games
